            <h3 class="topics">About kidneys</h3>
            <p class="about_kidneys">Kidneys as we all have heard they are bean shaped. They are located just below the
                rib cage. A good functioning of every part of our body is very important to deem ourselves fit.The kidneys’ main job is to filter extra water and waste out of your blood to make urine. </p>

                <p>To keep your body working properly, the kidneys balance the salts and minerals—such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium—that circulate in the blood. Your kidneys also make hormones that help control blood pressure, make red blood cells, and keep your bones strong.</p>
            
            <p> So kidneys play a vital role in maintaining the health of our body. It is very important to take care of
                the health of Kidney. A regular check-up with the doctors will help us to prevent ourselves from kidney
                failure or any other problems related to kidney.</p>
            <h3 class="topics">Why kidney is important to us!</h3>
            <p>The kidneys not only remove the waste from our body. They also remove the acid that is produced by the
                cells. Kidneys also play a vital role in homeostasis( refers to stability, balance, or equilibrium
                within a cell or the body). Without the help of Kidney we cannot expect our muscles, nerves to work
                properly.</p> 
            <p>Our kidneys play a major role in the following functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li> <strong>*</strong>  They help to maintain the overall fluid level in our body.</li>
                <li><strong>*</strong>  Help in regulating and filtering the minerals from blood.</li>
                <li><strong>*</strong>  Filters the waste materials from food, medications, and toxic substances.</li>
                <li><strong>*</strong>  Produces hormones that help produce red blood cells, promote bone health, and regulate blood
                    pressure.</li>
                <li><strong>*</strong>  Help in the Vitamin D activation and also in the production of vital vitamins.</li>
                <li><strong>*</strong>  Helps in keeping the regulation of the Blood Pressure.</li>
            </ul>

                <div class="how_your_kidney_work"></div>
            <p>The kidneys play a major role in maintaining your general health and wellbeing. Think of them as a very complex, environmentally friendly, waste disposal system. They sort non-recyclable waste from recyclable waste, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while also cleaning your blood. </p> 

            <p>    Most people are born with two kidneys, each one about the size of an adult fist, bean-shaped and weighing around 150 grams each. The kidneys are located at both sides of your backbone, just under the rib cage or above the small of your back. They are protected from injury by a large padding of fat, your lower ribs and several muscles.</p>
                
            <P>    Your blood supply circulates through the kidneys about 12 times every hour. Each day your kidneys process around 200 litres of blood. The kidneys make urine (wee) from excess fluid and unwanted chemicals or waste in your blood.</p>
                
             <P>   Urine flows down through narrow tubes called ureters to the bladder where it is stored. When you feel the need to wee, the urine passes out of your body through a tube called the urethra. Around one to two litres of waste leave your body each day as urine.</p>
