                <p class="about_kidneys">Kidneys as we all have heard they are bean shaped. They are located just below the
                    rib cage. A good functioning of every part of our body is very important to deem ourselves fit.The kidneys’ main job is to filter extra water and waste out of your blood to make urine. </p>

                    <p>To keep your body working properly, the kidneys balance the salts and minerals—such as calcium, phosphorus, sodium, and potassium—that circulate in the blood. Your kidneys also make hormones that help control blood pressure, make red blood cells, and keep your bones strong.</p>
                
                <p> So kidneys play a vital role in maintaining the health of our body. It is very important to take care of
                    the health of Kidney. A regular check-up with the doctors will help us to prevent ourselves from kidney
                    failure or any other problems related to kidney.</p>

                <p>The kidneys not only remove the waste from our body. They also remove the acid that is produced by the
                    cells. Kidneys also play a vital role in homeostasis( refers to stability, balance, or equilibrium
                    within a cell or the body). Without the help of Kidney we cannot expect our muscles, nerves to work
                    properly.</p> 
                <p>Our kidneys play a major role in the following functions:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li> <strong>*</strong>  They help to maintain the overall fluid level in our body.</li>
                    <li><strong>*</strong>  Help in regulating and filtering the minerals from blood.</li>
                    <li><strong>*</strong>  Filters the waste materials from food, medications, and toxic substances.</li>
                    <li><strong>*</strong>  Produces hormones that help produce red blood cells, promote bone health, and regulate blood
                        pressure.</li>
                    <li><strong>*</strong>  Help in the Vitamin D activation and also in the production of vital vitamins.</li>
                    <li><strong>*</strong>  Helps in keeping the regulation of the Blood Pressure.</li>

                <p>The kidneys play a major role in maintaining your general health and wellbeing. Think of them as a very complex, environmentally friendly, waste disposal system. They sort non-recyclable waste from recyclable waste, 24 hours a day, seven days a week, while also cleaning your blood. </p> 

                <p>    Most people are born with two kidneys, each one about the size of an adult fist, bean-shaped and weighing around 150 grams each. The kidneys are located at both sides of your backbone, just under the rib cage or above the small of your back. They are protected from injury by a large padding of fat, your lower ribs and several muscles.</p>
                    
                <P>    Your blood supply circulates through the kidneys about 12 times every hour. Each day your kidneys process around 200 litres of blood. The kidneys make urine (wee) from excess fluid and unwanted chemicals or waste in your blood.</p>
                    
                <P>   Urine flows down through narrow tubes called ureters to the bladder where it is stored. When you feel the need to wee, the urine passes out of your body through a tube called the urethra. Around one to two litres of waste leave your body each day as urine.</p>

                <p class="about_kidneys">
                    <p>Blood flows to the kidney through the renal arteries. The nephrons have filters. They can be called Glomerulus and tubule. The glomerulus helps to filter the blood. The tubule helps in the transportation I.e, it returns the needed substance and separates the waste.</p>
<p>The kidneys lie behind the peritoneum in the abdomen, on either side of the vertebral column.</p>
<p>They typically extend from T12 to L3. The right kidney is often situated slightly lower to the left kidney. This is due to the presence of the liver. Each kidney is approximately the length of three vertebrae.</p>
<p>The adrenal glands are situated immediately superior to the kidneys. They are present within a separate envelope of the renal fascia.</p>
<p>Kidneys are enclosed by the fats and facia.</p>
<p><strong>Renal fascia</strong> – encloses the kidneys and the suprarenal. It is also known as Gerota’s fascia or perirenal fascia</p>
<p><strong>Renal capsule</strong> – tough fibrous capsule.</p>
<p><strong>Perirenal fat</strong> – It is a collection of extra peritoneal fat.</p>
<p><strong>Pararenal fat</strong> – the fat that is mainly located on the posterolateral kidney.</p>
<p>The internal structure of a kidney is deep. The renal parenchyma is divided into two main areas – the outer <strong>cortex</strong> which extends to inner <strong>medulla</strong>, thus dividing it into triangular shapes – which are known as <strong>renal pyramids</strong>.</p>
<p>The apex of a renal pyramid is called a renal papilla. Each <strong>renal papilla</strong> is associated with a structure known as the <strong>minor calyx</strong>, which collects urine from the pyramids. Several minor calyces merge to form a <strong>major calyx</strong>. Urine passes through the major calyces into the <strong>renal pelvis</strong>, a flattened and funnel-shaped structure. From the renal pelvis, urine drains into the ureter, which transports it to the bladder for storage.</p>
<p>The <strong>renal hilum</strong> is a deep fissure that marks the medial margin of each kidney. This acts as a gateway to the kidney – normally the renal vessels and ureter enter/exit the kidney via this renal hilum. The kidneys are supplied blood through the renal artery through the renal hilum.</p>
