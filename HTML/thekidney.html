                <p class="about_kidneys">Kidneys as we all have heard they are bean shaped. They are located just below
                    the rib cage. A good functioning of every part of our body is very important to deem ourselves
                    fit.The kidneys’ main job is to filter extra water and waste out of your blood to make urine. </p>

                <p>To keep your body working properly, the kidneys balance the salts and minerals—such as calcium,
                    phosphorus, sodium, and potassium—that circulate in the blood. Your kidneys also make hormones that
                    help control blood pressure, make red blood cells, and keep your bones strong.</p>

                <p> So kidneys play a vital role in maintaining the health of our body. It is very important to take
                    care of the health of Kidney. A regular check-up with the doctors will help us to prevent ourselves
                    from kidney failure or any other problems related to kidney.</p>

                <h3 class="topics" id="why_kidneys_are_important">Why kidney is important to us!</h3>
                <p>The kidneys not only remove the waste from our body. They also remove the acid that is produced by
                    the cells. Kidneys also play a vital role in homeostasis( refers to stability, balance, or
                    equilibrium within a cell or the body). Without the help of Kidney we cannot expect our muscles,
                    nerves to work properly.</p>
                <p>Our kidneys play a major role in the following functions:</p>
                <ul class="bullets_required">
                    <li> They help to maintain the overall fluid level in our body.</li>
                    <li> Help in regulating and filtering the minerals from blood.</li>
                    <li> Filters the waste materials from food, medications, and toxic substances.</li>
                    <li> Produces hormones that help produce red blood cells, promote bone health, and regulate blood
                        pressure.</li>
                    <li> Help in the Vitamin D activation and also in the production of vital vitamins.</li>
                    <li> Helps in keeping the regulation of the Blood Pressure.</li>

                <ul class="bullets_required">
                    <li>Regular exercises help us to keep fit which will take care of cholesterol level of our body.
                    </li>
                    <li>A healthy and balanced diet is always necessary.</li>
                    <li>Keeping a track of our blood sugar levels will help us to know if the kidney has any problem
                        or not.</li>
                    <li>Always keep a track on the blood pressure levels.</li>
                    <li>If you feel thirsty drink water instead of cold beverages which contains sugar leading to
                        increase in the blood sugar and cholesterol levels. Always take water, the universal solution to
                        quench your thirst.</li>
                    <li>Avoid alcoholic beverages. They not only affect the lungs or hurt but also affect the health
                        of the kidneys. Repeated intake of alcohol can result in kidney failure.</li>
                    <li>Intake of water should be maximum. Water helps in the filtration process. The required
                        quantity of water should be drunk regularly.</li>
                    <li>Do not be lazy to pass the urine. Do not make yourself to go in the path full of stones.</li>
                    <li>Give up smoking.</li>
                    <li>Give up taking pain killers. They have the side effects of directly affecting the kidneys.
                    </li>
                    <li>Always have a kidney check up once in a year to know if your kidneys are functioning normally.
                    </li>
                    <li>Have enough deep sleep. Try to avoid stressful situations. Never get over stressed.</li>
                    <li>Take care of the health of the heart.</li>

                <p class="about_kidneys">
                    <p>Blood flows to the kidney through the renal arteries. The nephrons have filters. They can be
                        called Glomerulus and tubule. The glomerulus helps to filter the blood. The tubule helps in the
                        transportation I.e, it returns the needed substance and separates the waste.</p>
                    <p>The kidneys lie behind the peritoneum in the abdomen, on either side of the vertebral column.</p>
                    <p>They typically extend from T12 to L3. The right kidney is often situated slightly lower to the
                        left kidney. This is due to the presence of the liver. Each kidney is approximately the length
                        of three vertebrae.</p>
                    <p>The adrenal glands are situated immediately superior to the kidneys. They are present within a
                        separate envelope of the renal fascia.</p>
                    <p>Kidneys are enclosed by the fats and facia.</p>
                    <p><strong>Renal fascia</strong> – encloses the kidneys and the suprarenal. It is also known as
                        Gerota’s fascia or perirenal fascia</p>
                    <p><strong>Renal capsule</strong> – tough fibrous capsule.</p>
                    <p><strong>Perirenal fat</strong> – It is a collection of extra peritoneal fat.</p>
                    <p><strong>Pararenal fat</strong> – the fat that is mainly located on the posterolateral kidney.</p>
                    <p>The internal structure of a kidney is deep. The renal parenchyma is divided into two main areas –
                        the outer <strong>cortex</strong> which extends to inner <strong>medulla</strong>, thus dividing
                        it into triangular shapes – which are known as <strong>renal pyramids</strong>.</p>
                    <p>The apex of a renal pyramid is called a renal papilla. Each <strong>renal papilla</strong> is
                        associated with a structure known as the <strong>minor calyx</strong>, which collects urine from
                        the pyramids. Several minor calyces merge to form a <strong>major calyx</strong>. Urine passes
                        through the major calyces into the <strong>renal pelvis</strong>, a flattened and funnel-shaped
                        structure. From the renal pelvis, urine drains into the ureter, which transports it to the
                        bladder for storage.</p>
                    <p>The <strong>renal hilum</strong> is a deep fissure that marks the medial margin of each kidney.
                        This acts as a gateway to the kidney – normally the renal vessels and ureter enter/exit the
                        kidney via this renal hilum. The kidneys are supplied blood through the renal artery through the
                        renal hilum.</p>
