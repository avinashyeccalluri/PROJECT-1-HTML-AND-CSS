            <h3 class="topics">About kidneys</h3>
            <p class="about_kidneys">Kidneys as we all have heard they are bean shaped. They are located just below the
                rib cage. A good functioning of every part of our body is very important to deem ourselves fit. The
                kidneys are very helpful in filtering the blood.,the waste and other matters are excreted as urine. </p>
            <br>
            <p> So kidneys play a vital role in maintaining the health of our body. It is very important to take care of
                the health of Kidney. A regular check-up with the doctors will help us to prevent ourselves from kidney
                failure or any other problems related to kidney.</p>
            <h3 class="topics">Why kidney is important to us!</h3>
            <p>The kidneys not only remove the waste from our body. They also remove the acid that is produced by the
                cells. Kidneys also play a vital role in homeostasis( refers to stability, balance, or equilibrium
                within a cell or the body). Without the help of Kidney we cannot expect our muscles, nerves to work
                properly.</p> <br>
            <p>Our kidneys play a major role in the following functions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>They help to maintain the overall fluid level in our body.</li>
                <li>Help in regulating and filtering the minerals from blood.</li>
                <li>Filters the waste materials from food, medications, and toxic substances.</li>
                <li>Produces hormones that help produce red blood cells, promote bone health, and regulate blood
                    pressure.</li>
                <li>Help in the Vitamin D activation and also in the production of vital vitamins.</li>
                <li>Helps in keeping the regulation of the Blood Pressure.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="topics">Structure of Kidney</h3>
            <p>Blood flows to the kidney through the renal arteries. The nephrons have filters. They can be called
                Glomerulus and tubule. The glomerulus helps to filter the blood. The tubule helps in the transportation
                I.e, it returns the needed substance and separates the waste.
                The kidneys lie behind the peritoneum in the abdomen, on either side of the vertebral column.
                They typically extend from T12 to L3. The right kidney is often situated slightly lower to the left
                kidney. This is due to the presence of the liver. Each kidney is approximately the length of three
                vertebrae.
                The adrenal glands are situated immediately superior to the kidneys. They are present within a separate
                envelope of the renal fascia.
                Kidneys are enclosed by the fats and facia.
                <span class="bold_contents">Renal fascia – </span> encloses the kidneys and the suprarenal. It is also
                known as Gerota’s fascia or perirenal fascia
                <span class="bold_contents">Renal capsule –</span> tough fibrous capsule.
                <span class="bold_contents">Perirenal fat –</span> It is a collection of extra peritoneal fat.
                <span class="bold_contents">Pararenal fat –</span> the fat that is mainly located on the posterolateral
                kidney.
                The internal structure of a kidney is deep. The renal parenchyma is divided into two main areas – the
                outer cortex which extends to inner medulla, thus dividing it into triangular shapes – which are known
                as renal pyramids.
                The apex of a renal pyramid is called a renal papilla. Each renal papilla is associated with a structure
                known as the minor calyx, which collects urine from the pyramids. Several minor calyces merge to form a
                major calyx. Urine passes through the major calyces into the renal pelvis, a flattened and funnel-shaped
                structure. From the renal pelvis, urine drains into the ureter, which transports it to the bladder for
                storage.
                The renal hilum is a deep fissure that marks the medial margin of each kidney. This acts as a gateway to
                the kidney – normally the renal vessels and ureter enter/exit the kidney via this renal hilum. The
                kidneys are supplied blood through the renal artery through the renal hilum.</p>
