            <div class="topics">
                <h2>What is Chronic Kidney Disease</h2>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease is a slow and progressive loss of kidney function over a period of several
                    years.
                    Eventually, a person will develop permanent kidney failure.</p>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease, also known as chronic renal failure, chronic renal disease, or chronic kidney
                    failure, is much more widespread than people realize; it often goes undetected and undiagnosed until
                    the
                    disease is well advanced.</p>
                <p>It is not unusual for people to realize they have chronic kidney failure only when their kidney
                    function
                    is down to 25 percent of normal.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="topics">
                <h2>Do you Know?</h2>
                <p>The burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in India is approximately 800 per million population
                    (pmp),
                    and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is 150–200 per million population. The most
                    common
                    cause of CKD in population-based studies is diabetic nephropathy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="topics">
                <h2>What causes Chronic Kidney Disease?</h2>
                <p>The most common causes of Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) are <strong>high blood pressure</strong> and
                    <strong>diabetes</strong>.</p>
                <p>Each kidney contains about 1 million tiny filtering units, called nephrons. Any disease that injures
                    or scars the nephrons can cause kidney disease. Diabetes and high blood pressure can both damage
                    your nephrons.</p>
                <p>High blood pressure can also damage the blood vessels of your kidneys, heart, and brain. The kidneys
                    are highly vascularized, meaning they contain lots of blood vessels. So, blood vessel diseases are
                    generally dangerous to your kidneys.</p>
                <p>Autoimmune diseases such as lupus can damage blood vessels and can make antibodies against kidney
                    tissue.</p>
                <p>There are various other causes of CKD. For example, <strong>polycystic kidney disease</strong> is a
                    hereditary cause of CKD. <strong>Glomerulonephritis</strong> can be due to <strong>lupus</strong>.
                    It can also appear after a streptococcal infection.</p>

            <div class="topics">
                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Chronic kidney failure, as opposed to acute kidney failure, is a slow and gradually progressive
                    disease. Even if one kidney stops functioning, the other can carry out normal functions. It is not
                    usually until the disease is fairly well advanced and the condition has become severe that signs and
                    symptoms are noticeable; by which time most of the damage is irreversible.</p>
                <p>It is important that people who are at high risk of developing kidney disease have their kidney
                    functions regularly checked. Early detection can significantly help prevent serious kidney damage.
                </p>
                <p>The most common signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease include:</p>
                <ul class="bullets_required">
                    <li> Anemia</li>
                    <li> Blood in urine</li>

        <p>Cancer are generally genetically disease. It is not a communicable disease. So we need not fear
to have a chance to be affected by cancer just by a touch of a person who is affected by cancer.
The kidney cancer starts to rice from the cells of the kidneys. Kidney cancers can also be called
as “Renal Cell Carcinoma”.</p>
        <p>The cells of our body keeps growing. Some of the cells might be worn out or some of the cells
might be damaged. So to replace these cells new cells keep growing in our body. These are often
instructed by the DNA. DNA can also be called as genes. So if there is any changes in the genes
there is a chance for the person to be affected by Cancer. Genes are those that we obtain from our
ancestors. So if there is any of the ancestor affected by cancer, then there is a chance for the
successor to have the growth of the cancer cells in their body.</p>

<h3 class="topics" id="kidney_cancer_do_you_know">Do you know?</h3>
<p>Kidney cancer is found amongst people who are more than 55 years of age. Kidney cancer is
likely to affect either of the kidneys or both the kidneys. Treating them at the earliest will bring a
good relief to the patients. Because the tumour cells have the ability to spread to other parts of
the body and damage those cells and tissues thus creating a bigger problem than the earlier.</p>
<div class="topics" id="kidney_cancer_types">Types of Kidney Cancer</div>
<p>There are two types of Kidney cancer.</p>
<p>The primary cancer is one in which the tumour cells does not spread to any other parts of the
body. This type of cancer can also be called as a localised cancer.</p>
<p>The Secondary Cancer has the effect if spreading the affected cells to the other parts of the
body. It could be called as metastatic or advanced cancer.</p>
<p>One thing that is to be noted is that it is very rare for the tumour cells to spread from other parts
of the body to the kidneys.</p>
<h3 class="topics" id="kidney_cancer_causes">What are the causes?</h3>
<p>The risk factors that help in the arousal of the kidney cancers are</p>
<ul>
    <li>Age is the major factor</li>
    <li>Smoking, high BP, stress</li>
    <li>Kidney Stones</li>
    <li>obesity</li>
    <li>long-term dialysis and acquired cystic disease</li>
    <li>specific genetic and hereditary conditions</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="topics" id="kidney_cancer_symptoms">What are the symptoms?</h3>
<p>The following symptoms may rise in a person if he or she might be prone to kidney cancer:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Blood in the urine</li>
    <li>Changes in colour of urine from light yellow to dark, rusty or brown </li>
    <li>Lower back, abdominal or flank pain without being affected by an injury</li>
    <li>Sudden weight loss</li>
    <li>Suddenly developed high blood pressure</li>
    <li>Frequent tiredness</li>
    <li>Fever or night sweats</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="topics" id="kidney_cancer_diagnosied_preventive_methods">Diagnosing and Preventive methods</h3>
<p>The most common tests that may be ordered for the person to diagnose kidney cancer include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Ultrasound – To look for irregularities in the kidney and other organs.</li>
    <li>Scans – Computer tomography (CT) scans or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans to provide detailed pictures of organs in the body. </li>
    <li>Chest x-ray – An X-ray of organs and bones within the chest.</li>
    <li>Urine test (urinalysis) – To detect other irregularities in the urine, such as protein.</li>
    <li>Blood tests – Chemical tests of the blood to find things associated with kidney cancer.</li>
    <li>Intravenous pyelogram (IVP) – A dye is injected into a vein and X-rays are used to map its path through the kidneys and into the urine.</li>
    <li>Cytoscopy – A test to check the bladder and urethra for cancers.</li>
    <li>Bone scan – To detect if cancer has spread to the bones.</li>

            <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_stones">What are Kidney Stones?</h3>
            <p>Kidney stones are rock-like crystals that are hard and are of varying sizes and shapes formed in the kidneys. There are four main types of kidney stones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Calcium combined with oxalate or phosphate- the most common type
                </li>
                <li>
                    Struvite stones- caused by urine infection, horn-shaped and quite large
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uric acid stones- softer than other forms of kidney stone
                </li>
                <li>
                    Cystine stones-  rare and hereditary. Crystalline form than being stones
                </li>    
            </ul>
            <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_stone_causes">Causes</h3>
            <p>There is no specific reason in the formation of the kidney stones. They are most probably formed if there is high level of Calcium or phosphate or oxalate in the body. They may be sometimes formed due to the medications that are followed for the treatment of Kidney cancer or HIV.</p>
            <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_stones_experoance">What are the symptoms that a person might experience if the stones are formed in kidney?</h3>
            <p>The formation of the kidney stones is sometimes a hereditary disease. The symptoms include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Pain called as renal colic- happens when the stone moves into urine tract</li>
                <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                <li>Pain in the back below the ribs</li>
                <li>Pain in the groin</li>
