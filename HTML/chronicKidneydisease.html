            <h1 class="kidney">Chronic Kidney Disease</h1>
            <div class="topics">What is Chronic Kidney Disease</div>
            <p>Chronic kidney disease is a slow and progressive loss of kidney function over a period of several years. Eventually, a person will develop permanent kidney failure.</p>
<p>Chronic kidney disease, also known as chronic renal failure, chronic renal disease, or chronic kidney failure, is much more widespread than people realize; it often goes undetected and undiagnosed until the disease is well advanced.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for people to realize they have chronic kidney failure only when their kidney function is down to 25 percent of normal.</p>
            <div class="topics">Do you Know?</div>
            <p>The burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in India is approximately 800 per million population (pmp), and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is 150â€“200 per million population. The most common cause of CKD in population-based studies is diabetic nephropathy.</p>
            <div class="topics">What causes Chronic Kidney Disease?</div>
            <p>The most common causes of Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) are <strong>high blood pressure</strong> and <strong>diabetes</strong>.</p>
<p>Each kidney contains about 1 million tiny filtering units, called nephrons. Any disease that injures or scars the nephrons can cause kidney disease. Diabetes and high blood pressure can both damage your nephrons.</p>
<p>High blood pressure can also damage the blood vessels of your kidneys, heart, and brain. The kidneys are highly vascularized, meaning they contain lots of blood vessels. So, blood vessel diseases are generally dangerous to your kidneys.</p>
<p>Autoimmune diseases such as lupus can damage blood vessels and can make antibodies against kidney tissue.</p>
<p>There are various other causes of CKD. For example, <strong>polycystic kidney disease</strong> is a hereditary cause of CKD. <strong>Glomerulonephritis</strong> can be due to <strong>lupus</strong>. It can also appear after a streptococcal infection.</p>
<div class="topics">Symptoms</div>
<p>Chronic kidney failure, as opposed to acute kidney failure, is a slow and gradually progressive disease. Even if one kidney stops functioning, the other can carry out normal functions. It is not usually until the disease is fairly well advanced and the condition has become severe that signs and symptoms are noticeable; by which time most of the damage is irreversible.</p>
<p>It is important that people who are at high risk of developing kidney disease have their kidney functions regularly checked. Early detection can significantly help prevent serious kidney damage.</p>
<p>The most common signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease include:</p>
<ul>
    <li>* anemia</li>
    <li>* blood in urine</li>
    <li>* dark urine</li>
    <li>* decreased mental alertness</li>
    <li>*decreased urine output</li>
    <li>* edema - swollen feet, hands, and ankles (face if edema is severe)</li>
    <li>* fatigue (tiredness)</li>
    <li>* hypertension (high blood pressure)</li>
    <li>* insomnia</li>
    <li>* itchy skin, can become persistent</li>
    <li>* loss of appetite</li>
    <li>* male inability to get or maintain an erection (erectile dysfunction)</li>
    <li>* more frequent urination, especially at night</li>
    <li>* muscle cramps</li>
    <li>* muscle twitches</li>
    <li>* nausea</li>
    <li>* pain on the side or mid to lower back</li>
    <li>* panting (shortness of breath)</li>
    <li>* unexplained headaches</li>
</ul>

<div class="topics">Prevetion Steps</div>
<p>You can protect your kidneys by preventing or managing health conditions that cause kidney damage, such as diabetes and high blood pressure. The steps described below may help keep your whole body healthy, including your kidneys.</p>
