                <h2>What is Chronic Kidney Disease</h2>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease is a slow and progressive loss of kidney function over a period of several
                    years.
                    Eventually, a person will develop permanent kidney failure.</p>
                <p>Chronic kidney disease, also known as chronic renal failure, chronic renal disease, or chronic kidney
                    failure, is much more widespread than people realize; it often goes undetected and undiagnosed until
                    the
                    disease is well advanced.</p>
                <p>It is not unusual for people to realize they have chronic kidney failure only when their kidney
                    function
                    is down to 25 percent of normal.</p>

                <h2>Do you Know?</h2>
                <p>The burden of chronic kidney disease (CKD) in India is approximately 800 per million population
                    (pmp),
                    and the incidence of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is 150â€“200 per million population. The most
                    common
                    cause of CKD in population-based studies is diabetic nephropathy.</p>

                <h2>What causes Chronic Kidney Disease?</h2>
                <p>The most common causes of Chronic Kidney Disease(CKD) are <strong>high blood pressure</strong> and
                    <strong>diabetes</strong>.</p>
                <p>Each kidney contains about 1 million tiny filtering units, called nephrons. Any disease that injures
                    or scars the nephrons can cause kidney disease. Diabetes and high blood pressure can both damage
                    your nephrons.</p>
                <p>High blood pressure can also damage the blood vessels of your kidneys, heart, and brain. The kidneys
                    are highly vascularized, meaning they contain lots of blood vessels. So, blood vessel diseases are
                    generally dangerous to your kidneys.</p>
                <p>Autoimmune diseases such as lupus can damage blood vessels and can make antibodies against kidney
                    tissue.</p>
                <p>There are various other causes of CKD. For example, <strong>polycystic kidney disease</strong> is a
                    hereditary cause of CKD. <strong>Glomerulonephritis</strong> can be due to <strong>lupus</strong>.
                    It can also appear after a streptococcal infection.</p>

                <h2>Symptoms</h2>
                <p>Chronic kidney failure, as opposed to acute kidney failure, is a slow and gradually progressive
                    disease. Even if one kidney stops functioning, the other can carry out normal functions. It is not
                    usually until the disease is fairly well advanced and the condition has become severe that signs and
                    symptoms are noticeable; by which time most of the damage is irreversible.</p>
                <p>It is important that people who are at high risk of developing kidney disease have their kidney
                    functions regularly checked. Early detection can significantly help prevent serious kidney damage.
                </p>
                <p>The most common signs and symptoms of chronic kidney disease include:</p>
                <ul class="bullets_required">

                <h2>Prevetion Steps</h2>
                <p>You can protect your kidneys by preventing or managing health conditions that cause kidney damage,
                    such as diabetes and high blood pressure. The steps described below may help keep your whole body
