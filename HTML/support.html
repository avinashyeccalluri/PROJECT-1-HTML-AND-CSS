                    <p>Dialysis is a kind of replacement to the kidney. This treatment helps to do the functions
                        that
                        the healthy kidneys always perform. A doctor would come to this solution only when the
                        kidneys
                        can no more function properly.</p>

                    <h4 class="topic_heading">Funtions of Dialysis</h4>
                    <p>Removal of the salt , waste and unwanted  acids from the body. </p>
                    <p> Prevents the extra days or water to stay in body thereby preventing from the building up of
                        the
                        body. </p>

                    <p>It is done at least three times a week and lasts for at least four to five hours. It offers
                        flexibility in the timing of the dialysis and how many hours it is to be done. Because there
                        would be no need for the person to go to the clinic. Being in home always does not give the
                        feeling that the person is being treated as a patient which is also a cure for our mental
                        health.</p>
                    <p>Flexibility, independence and control are the key advantages in the HHD. This is because
                        unlike the satellite haemodialysis or hospital dialysis the person can choose the number of
                        times and the days he wanted the dialysis to be done for him/ her. There would be no mental
                        stress in the home. They will never feel as a patients while undergoing the dialysis in a place
                        where they dwell. So it is highly advantageous than going to the hospital. This ignorance will
                        make them to heal quite quickly.</p>
                    <p>For our better health conditions the HHD of additional hours is a good solution as it may
                        also help to increase the recovery time.</p>

                    <p>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a treatment that makes use the lining of the abdomen called
                        peritoneum. A cleaning solution called dialysate is used to clean the blood. Dialysate
                        absorbs
                        waste and fluid from your blood, using your peritoneum as a filter. Peritoneal dialysis is
                        portable.</p>
                    <p>It can be done in the home as well. The caution is that the place should be neat and clean.
                        Hence the person’s will have a greater freedom.</p>

                        will vary according to the needs. If you are travelling after the dialysis process then an
                        extra of two hours would be taken to do the treatment along with the general timing of 4-6
                        hours.</p>

                    <p>In comparison with a lifetime on dialysis, the kidney transplantation is a good treatment of
                        choice for kidney failure. A kidney transplant helps in the chronic kidney disease or end-stage
                        renal disease to help the patient feel better and also to extend his/her life. Advantages of
                        transplantation over dialysis is that</p>
                    <ul class="bullets_required">
                        <li>It gives better quality of life</li>
                        <li>Lower risk of death</li>
                        <li>Fewer dietary restrictions</li>
                        <li>Lower treatment cost</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>But for certain people with kidney failure, a kidney transplant may be more risky than dialysis.
                        Conditions that may prevent you from being eligible for a kidney transplant include:</p>
                    <ul class="bullets_required">
                        <li>Advanced age</li>
                        <li>Severe heart disease</li>
                        <li>Active or recently treated cancer</li>
                        <li>Dementia or poorly controlled mental illness</li>
                        <li>Alcohol or drug abuse</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>Any other factor that could affect the ability to safely undergo the procedure and take the
                        medications needed after a transplant to prevent organ rejection</p>
                    <p>Only one donated kidney is needed to replace two failed kidneys, making living-donor kidney
                        transplantation an option.</p>
                    <p>Transplantation is not a complete cure for a Kidney disease. It is an alternative for dialysis
                        and it offers a longer life span and active function of the kidneys. If the person is medically
                        fit then he can have a kidney transplantation. Usually the kidney is transplanted from a
                        deceased person or a living person. Only after making a thorough check if the donor, the
                        transplantation is done. There are certain medical tests that the donor has to undergo before
                        the kidney transplantation of he/she is a live donor. It includes:</p>

                    <p>If you want to be a kidney donor then you have to follow certain things in order to be a perfect
                        donor. It includes:</p>
                    <ul class="bullets_required">
                        <li>Following the dietary restrictions</li>
                        <li>Regular fitness</li>
                        <li>Regular exercises</li>
                        <li>Having an ideal body weight</li>
                    </ul>

                <div id="transplantation_procedure">
                    <h3 class="topic_heading">Procedure of transplantation and aftermath</h3>
                    <p>The operation involved in the transplantation process takes about 3-4 hours. About 2 hours will
                        be needed for its recovery. The kidney will be connected to the bladder for the future functions
                        of kidney. After the transplantation certain kidneys start to function after a few hours in
                        certain cases it might take some time.</p>
                    <p>After the transplantation there are some medications that a person should follow so that the body
                        accepts the kidney earlier. An important thing that is to be kept in the mind of the acceptor is
                        that he or she should not stop the medications. If it is stopped then the life of the donated
                        kidney may be reduced. So it is good to have a talk with the doctor before the transplantation.

                    <p>Do you feel that you have to save someone's life? Then Organ donation is the best choice. The
                        organ donation does not make only that person to exist. But it benefits a family. You donate an
                        organ and you make a family to live. This is really the best way to complete your living.</p>
                    <p>Anyone can be a potential donor Regardless of age or race or status anyone can be a potential
                        donor. But a person's medical history is quite a important consideration in this process. It
                        would ensure that the organ that is transplanted does not create any further problems for both
                        the donor and the acceptor.</p>
                    <p>Adults can make living donations, meaning that living adults can choose to give an organ, like a
                        kidney, or part of an organ, like a liver, to someone in need.</p>
