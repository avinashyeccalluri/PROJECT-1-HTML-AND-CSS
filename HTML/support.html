                        <p>It is the inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys (glomeruli). Glomeruli remove
                            excess fluid, electrolytes and waste from your bloodstream and pass them into the urine.
                            This disease can develop gradually or acutely. If a person is affected by lupus or he/she is
                            diabetic there are chances that the person might develop the disease. But Glomerulonephritis
                            also has the ability to arise on its own.</p>

                        <p>In the earlier stage of the disease, the severity will be very less. So the treatment will be
                            focused on slowing the severity of kidney disease. There will be treatments that would
                            reduce the occurrence of the cardiovascular diseases. If you come to know that you may be
                            affected by any of the kidney disease then you will have to change the lifestyle that will
                            help to reduce the development of the disease. The medications prescribed by the doctor will
                            also be less when half of the work is done by the changes on the lifestyle. A regular kidney
                            health check will also be done by the doctor on regular basis to keep on track about the
                            disease.</p>

                        <p>The middle stage has the risk of developing bone diseases and anemia. Because the stagnant of
                            waste caused by the chronic kidney disease will start to increase. The focus of treatment
                            will be as same as the treatment of the early stage. An extra effort will be taken by the
                            doctors to reduce the complications of the disease. At this stage it is good to approach a
                            kidney specialist who would guide you in the correct way so that the severity of the disease
                            does not improve. Frequent tests of blood and urine will help to track the level of disease.

                    <p>Dialysis is a kind of replacement to the kidney. This treatment helps to do the functions that
                        the healthy kidneys always perform. A doctor would come to this solution only when the kidneys
                        can no more function properly.</p>

                    <p>It is done at least three times a week and lasts for at least four to five hours. It offers
                        flexibility in the timing of the dialysis and how many hours it is to be done. Because there
                        would be no need for the person to go to the clinic. Being in home always does not give the
                        feeling that the person is being treated as a patient which is also a cure for our mental
                        health.</p>
                    <p>Flexibility, independence and control are the key advantages in the HHD. This is because unlike
                        the satellite haemodialysis or hospital dialysis the person can choose the number of times and
                        the days he wanted the dialysis to be done for him/ her. There would be no mental stress in the
                        home. They will never feel as a patients while undergoing the dialysis in a place where they
                        dwell. So it is highly advantageous than going to the hospital. This ignorance will make them to
                        heal quite quickly.</p>
                    <p>For our better health conditions the HHD of additional hours is a good solution as it may also
                        help to increase the recovery time.</p>

                    <p>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a treatment that makes use the lining of the abdomen called
                        peritoneum. A cleaning solution called dialysate is used to clean the blood. Dialysate absorbs
                        waste and fluid from your blood, using your peritoneum as a filter. Peritoneal dialysis is
                        portable. </p>
                    <p>It can be done in the home as well. The caution is that the place should be neat and clean. Hence

                        But for certain people with kidney failure, a kidney transplant may be more risky than dialysis.
                        Conditions that may prevent you from being eligible for a kidney transplant include:

                    <p>Any other factor that could affect the ability to safely undergo the procedure and take the
                        medications needed after a transplant to prevent organ rejection</p>
                    <p>Only one donated kidney is needed to replace two failed kidneys, making living-donor kidney
                        transplantation an option.</p>
                    <p>Transplantation is not a complete cure for a Kidney disease. It is an alternative for dialysis
                        and it offers a longer life span and active function of the kidneys. If the person is medically
                        fit then he can have a kidney transplantation. Usually the kidney is transplanted from a
                        deceased person or a living person. Only after making a thorough check if the donor, the
                        transplantation is done. There are certain medical tests that the donor has to undergo before
                        the kidney transplantation of he/she is a live donor. It includes:</p>

                    <p>If you want to be a kidney donor then you have to follow certain things in order to be a perfect
                        donor. It includes:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Following the dietary restrictions
                        </li>

                    <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_transplantaion_transplantation">Procedure of transplantation and
                        aftermath</h3>
                    <p>
                        The operation involved in the transplantation process takes about 3-4 hours. About 2 hours will
                        be needed for its recovery. The kidney will be connected to the bladder for the future functions
                        of kidney. After the transplantation certain kidneys start to function after a few hours in
                        certain cases it might take some time.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        After the transplantation there are some medications that a person should follow so that the
                        body accepts the kidney earlier. An important thing that is to be kept in the mind of the
                        acceptor is that he or she should not stop the medications. If it is stopped then the life of
                        the donated kidney may be reduced. So it is good to have a talk with the doctor before the
                        transplantation.
