                <p>It is the inflammation of the tiny filters in your kidneys (glomeruli). Glomeruli remove excess fluid, electrolytes and waste from your bloodstream and pass them into the urine. This disease can develop gradually or acutely. If a person is affected by lupus or he/she is diabetic there are chances that the person might develop the disease. But Glomerulonephritis also has the ability to arise on its own.</p>

                <p>There are certain infections that may be caused by glomerulonephritis. It includes</p>
                <p><span class="bold"> Post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis :</span> It may develop after the recovery from a throat infection or a skin infection. Our body produces extra antibodies to fight against the disease that can eventually settle in the glomeruli, causing inflammation.</p>
                <p>Children are more likely prone to develop post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis than are adults. They also have the tendency to cure earlier.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Bacterial endocarditis:</span> Bacteria occasionally can spread through your bloodstream and lodge in your heart, causing an infection of one or more of your heart valves. If a person is suffering from heart disease then he/she  is at a major risk.</p>
                <h3 class="topics" id="types_of_kidney_diseases_immune_diseases">Immune diseases</h3>
                <p><span class="bold">Lupus:</span> It is a  chronic inflammatory disease that has the ability to affect skin, joints, kidneys, blood cells, heart and lungs.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">Good pasture’s syndrome:</span> It is a rare immunological lung disorder that can cause bleeding in the lungs as well as glomerulonephritis.</p>
                <p><span class="bold">IgA nephropathy:</span> It is characterised by recurrent blood in the urine. It results from deposits of immunoglobulin A (IgA) in the glomeruli. There would be no symptoms for two years in the progress of IgA nephropathy.</p>
                <p>The impact that the glomerulonephritis can have are:</p>
                <ul>

                <p>A good control of blood sugar level and blood pressure can <span class="bold">prevent</span> the  person being a victim to glomerulonephritis.</p>
                <p>The treatment if the kidney diseases may vary in accordance with the severity. That is it depends on the stage in which the disease has risen. We can divide the stage into 3</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Early stage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Middle stage
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Later stage
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h3 class="topics" id="types_of_kidney_diseases_earlier_earlier">Earlier Stages</h3>
                <p>In the earlier stage of the disease, the severity will be very less. So the treatment will be focused on slowing the severity of kidney disease. There will be treatments that would reduce the occurrence of the cardiovascular diseases. If you come to know that you may be affected by any of the kidney disease then you will have to change the lifestyle that will help to reduce the development of the disease. The medications prescribed by the doctor will also be less when half of the work is done by the changes on the lifestyle. A regular kidney health check will also be done by the doctor on regular basis to keep on track about the disease.</p>
                <h3 class="topics" id="types_of_kidney_diseases_earlier_middle">Middle Stages</h3>
                <p>The middle stage has the risk of developing bone diseases and anemia. Because the stagnant of waste caused by the chronic kidney disease will start to increase.  The focus of  treatment will be as same as the  treatment of the early stage. An extra effort will be taken by the doctors to reduce the complications of the disease.  At this stage it is good to approach a kidney specialist who would guide you in the correct way so that the severity of the disease does not improve.   Frequent tests of blood and urine will help to track the level of disease.</p>
                <h3 class="topics" id="types_of_kidney_diseases_earlier_later">Later Stages</h3>
                <p>This stage can also be called as the end stage of kidney's life or also called as kidney failure (renal failure).  This is the case where Kidney transplantation and dialysis plays a major role in the treatment of the affected kidney. Because in this stage the entire function of the kidney may come to halt having a need for the replacement or supplement.</p>

        <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_dialysis">Kidney Dialysis </h3>
        <p>Dialysis is a kind of replacement to the kidney. This treatment helps to do the functions that the healthy kidneys always perform. A doctor would come to this solution only when the kidneys can no more function properly.</p>
        <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_dialysis_function">Funtions of Dialysis</h3>
        <p>Removal of the salt , waste and unwanted  acids from the body. </p>
        <p> Prevents the extra days or water to stay in body thereby preventing from the building up of the body.   </p>
        <p> It sees to that the chemicals in the body are maintained at the proper level.  </p>
        <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_dialysis_haemodialysis">Home haemodialysis (HHD) </h3>
        <p>It is done at least three times a week and lasts for at least four to five hours. It offers flexibility in the timing of the dialysis and how many hours it is to be done. Because there would be no need for the person to go to the clinic. Being in home always does not give the feeling that the person is being treated as a patient which is also a cure for our mental health.</p>
        <p>Flexibility, independence and control are the key advantages in the HHD. This is because unlike the satellite haemodialysis or hospital dialysis the person can choose the number of times and the days he wanted the dialysis to be done for him/ her. There would be no mental stress in the home. They will never feel as a patients while undergoing the dialysis in a place where they dwell. So it is highly advantageous than going to the hospital. This ignorance will make them to heal quite quickly.</p>
        <p>For our better health conditions the HHD of additional hours is a good solution as it may also help to increase the recovery time.</p>
        <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_dialysis_peritonial">Peritoneal dialysis:</h3>
        <p>Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a treatment that makes use the lining of the abdomen called peritoneum. A cleaning solution called dialysate is used to clean the blood. Dialysate absorbs waste and fluid from your blood, using your peritoneum as a filter. Peritoneal dialysis is portable. </p>
        <p>It can be done in the home as well. The caution is that the place should be neat and clean. Hence the person’s will have a greater freedom.</p>
        <h3 class="contents" id="kidney_dialysis_two_types">Two types</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) - the day-time bags
            </li>
            <li>
                automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) -  the overnight machine
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_dialysis_capd">CAPD </h3>
        <p>It is a machine free kind of dialysis. It can be done when the person is involved in the normal works also. So it does not be an obstacle to stop our regular works.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Portable type of Dialysis</li>
            <li>Done everyday through the peritoneal cavity by inserting the bag that contains the peritoneal dialysis fluids.</li>
            <li>A catheter is generally used for the purpose of letting in the fluids without any change I the path of the flow.</li>
            <li>The fluid has the ability to attract the  water and all the waste from the blood.</li>

        </ul>
        <p>The bag has to be changed four times a day. This change is called as the PD cycle. There are two process that is involved in purifying the blood. They are Osmosis and Diffusion.</p>
        <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_dialysis_apd">APD</h3>
        <p>It can also be called as Continuous Cyclic Peritoneal Dialysis (CCPD).  It involves the use of the machine or also called as the cycler unlike the CAPD. In this method a machine is programmed to control how much fluid goes in and out and how often this happens. In case the machine is not working or we have to travel out then we can use manual CAPD bags.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                On average, five to eight exchanges (cycles) of about two litre’s each go in and out of the peritoneal cavity overnight.
            </li>
            <li>
                The cycle plans when the fluid should be given and when it should be drained out.            </li>
            <li>
                It is not a portable type            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3 class="topics" id="kidney_dialysis_center_based_dialysis">Centre based Dialysis</h3>
        <p>In this method the dialysis takes place in the hospital. The person has to travel to the hospital to take the treatment. There is another version of haemodialysis called as haemodiafiltration. Generally the person will have three appointments in a week. The hours will vary according to the needs. If you are travelling after the dialysis process then an extra of two hours would be taken to do the treatment along with the general timing of 4-6 hours.</p>
        <p>After the dialysis it's in the hands of the patient to take care without leading to further complications.</p>
