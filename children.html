                    <h1 class="page_heading">8 Ways to Keep Your Kidneys Healthy </h1>
                    <h3 class="topic_heading">1. Keep active and fit</h3>                    
                    <p>Regular exercise is good for more than just your waistline. It can lower the risk of chronic kidney disease. It can also reduce your blood pressure and boost your heart health, which are both important to preventing kidney damage.</p>
                    <p>You don’t have to run marathons to reap the reward of exercise. Walking, running, cycling, and even dancing are great for your health. Find an activity that keeps you busy and have fun. It’ll be easier to stick to it and have great results.</p>
                    <h3 class="topic_heading">2. Control your blood sugar</h3>
                    <p>People with diabetes, or a condition that causes high blood sugar, may develop kidney damage. When your body’s cells can’t use the glucose (sugar) in your blood, your kidneys are forced to work extra hard to filter your blood. Over years of exertion, this can lead to life-threatening damage.</p>
                    <p>However, if you can control your blood sugar, you reduce the risk of damage. Also, if the damage is caught early, your doctor can take steps to reduce or prevent additional damage.</p>
                    <h3 class="topic_heading">3. Monitor blood pressure</h3>
                    <p>High blood pressure can cause kidney damage. If high blood pressure occurs with other health issues like diabetes, heart disease, or high cholesterol, the impact on your body can be significant.</p>
                    <p>A healthy blood pressure reading is 120/80. Prehypertension is between that point and 139/89. Lifestyle and dietary changes may help lower your blood pressure at this point.</p>
                    <p>If your blood pressure readings are consistently above 140/90, you may have high blood pressure. You should talk with your doctor about monitoring your blood pressure regularly, making changes to your lifestyle, and possibly taking medication.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic_heading">4. Monitor weight and eat a healthy diet</h3>
                    <p>People who are overweight or obese are at risk for a number of health conditions that can damage the kidneys. These include diabetes, heart disease, and kidney disease.</p>
                    <p>A healthy diet that’s low in sodium, processed meats, and other kidney-damaging foods may help reduce the risk of kidney damage. Focus on eating fresh ingredients that are naturally low-sodium, such as cauliflower, blueberries, fish, whole grains, and more.</p>
                    <h3 class="topic_heading">5. Drink plenty of fluids</h3>
                    <p>There’s no magic behind the cliché advice to drink eight glasses of water a day, but it’s a good goal precisely because it encourages you to stay hydrated. Regular, consistent water intake is healthy for your kidneys.</p>
                    <p>Water helps clear sodium and toxins from your kidneys. It also lowers your risk of chronic kidney disease.</p>
                    <p>Aim for at least 1.5 to 2 liters in a day. Exactly how much water you need depends largely on your health and lifestyle. Factors like climate, exercise, gender, overall health, and whether or not you’re pregnant or breastfeeding are important to consider when planning your daily water intake.</p>
                    <p>People who have previously had kidney stones should drink a bit more water to help prevent stone deposits in the future.</p>
                    <h3 class="topic_heading">6. Don’t smoke</h3>
                    <p>Smoking damages your body’s blood vessels. This leads to slower blood flow throughout your body and to your kidneys.</p>
                    <p>Smoking also puts your kidneys at an increased risk for cancer. If you stop smoking, your risk will drop. However, it’ll take many years to return to the risk level of a person who’s never smoked.</p>

                    <h3 class="topic_heading">7. Be aware of the amount of OTC pills you take</h3>
                    <p>If you regularly take over-the-counter (OTC) pain medication, you may be causing kidney damage. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including ibuprofen and naproxen, can damage your kidneys if you take them regularly for chronic pain, headaches, or arthritis.</p>
                    <p>People with no kidney issues who take the medicine occasionally are likely in the clear. However, if you use these medicines daily, you could be risking your kidneys’ health. Talk with your doctor about kidney-safe treatments if you’re coping with pain.</p>
                    <h3 class="topic_heading">8. Have your kidney function tested if you’re at high risk</h3>
                    <p>If you’re at high risk of kidney damage or kidney disease, it’s a good idea to have regular kidney function tests. The following people may benefit from regular screening:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>people who are over 60 years old</li>
                        <li>people who were born at a low birth weight</li>
                        <li>people who have cardiovascular disease or have family with it</li>
                        <li>people who have or have a family history of high blood pressure</li>
                        <li>people who are obese</li>
                        <li>people who believe they may have kidney damage</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>A regular kidney function test is a great way to know your kidney’s health and to check for possible changes. Getting ahead of any damage can help slow or prevent future damage.</p>

                <div id="things_you_dont_about_kidney">
                    <h1 class="page_heading">11 Things You Didn't Know About Your Kidneys</h1>
                    <p>1. Diabetes is especially bad for your kidneys. “It can do microvascular damage in your body, affecting the small blood vessels in organs like your eyes, and yes, in your kidneys,” says Vassalotti. Thirty million patients have both diabetes and kidney disease. Make sure your doctor is monitoring your glucose levels if you have diabetes or prediabetes.</p>
                    <p>2. Exercise combats CKD. Just 30 minutes of movement three days a week improves your blood vessel health, which in turn boosts your kidney function.</p>
                    <p>3. Too much alcohol can keep your kidneys from filtering your blood properly. Limit yourself to no more than two drinks per day—and less is better.</p>
                    <p>4. The DASH diet is also good for your kidneys. High blood pressure can damage the blood vessels in the kidneys, making them less effective at clearing out toxins. Take a cue from the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet, an eating plan recommended by the American Heart Association and the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute for optimum health. Slash sodium and red meat intake and fill up on fruits and vegetables. (Visit Parade.com/DASH for more detailed guidelines.)</p>
                    <p>5. Your kidneys need clean air. A new study from Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis and the Veterans’ Affairs Clinical Epidemiology Center finds that breathing air containing dust, dirt, smoke and soot can disrupt kidney function. “Nano-particles [of these substances] enter the lungs—because they are so small, they are able to penetrate into the bloodstream,” says senior study author Ziyad Al-Aly, MD. “What makes your kidneys especially vulnerable is that they filter 45 gallons of blood a day.” Protect yourself by keeping your car windows up while in traffic and using an air purifier at home.</p>
                    <p>6. Certain heartburn drugs, known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs), may cause gradual kidney damage. “We only very partially understand how PPIs cause kidney injury, but some patients don’t fully recover,” Al-Aly says. A lot of people take these drugs when they don’t need to, he adds, so make sure you use the lowest effective dose for the shortest period of time.</p>
                    <p>7. Bubbles in your urine could indicate kidney problems. That, as well as foam or fizziness, could indicate the presence of protein in your urine, a potential sign of kidney disease.</p>
                    <p>8. Your kidneys want you to quit smoking, too. Cigarettes slow healthy blood flow to your organs, including your kidneys. Plus, if you smoke and you’re on high blood pressure meds, you’re likely not getting the full benefits of the drugs.</p>
                    <p>9. Getting 7-8 hours of sleep a night cuts a key kidney disease-related risk factor. High blood pressure, the second leading cause of kidney failure, can be exacerbated by insomnia or poor sleep.</p>
                    <p>10. A wide variety of symptoms could indicate CKD, including nausea, vomiting, loss of appetite, fatigue, sleep issues, changes in urination, changes in your mental sharpness, muscle cramps or twitches, swelling of your feet and ankles, itching that doesn’t go away, chest pain and shortness of breath.</p>
                    <p>11. Some kidney change is normal as we age. “After 50, we all start to lose some kidney function, but for most people, that’s of little consequence,” Vassalotti says. “Just remember that taking care of yourself and living a healthy lifestyle is your best protection.”</p>
